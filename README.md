An Arduino Uno based, 3D printed robot taken from David Hrbaty's design. I used an Ultrasonic Sensor, 2x HiTec 311 servo motors (need to be modified for continous rotation), a mini servo, Arduino prototype shield with mini breadboard, IR receiver, a buzzer, IR remote, and 9v battery with buckle to power jack.
modified for continous rotation), a mini servo, Arduino prototype shield with mini breadboard, IR receiver, a buzzer, IR remote, and 9v battery with buckle to power jack.

ArduBot is fully controlled by IR remote control and it has 3 modes:
- Manually controlled by IR remote 
- Autonomous mode 
- Monitor mode
