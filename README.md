An Arduino Uno based, 3D printed robot taken from David Hrbaty's design. I used an Ultrasonic Sensor, 2x HiTec 311 servo motors (need to be modified for continous rotation), a mini servo, Arduino prototype shield with mini breadboard, IR receiver, a buzzer, IR remote, and 9v battery with buckle to power jack.
modified for continous rotation), a mini servo, Arduino prototype shield with mini breadboard, IR receiver, a buzzer, IR remote, and 9v battery with buckle to power jack.

ArduBot is fully controlled by IR remote control and it has 3 modes:
- Manually controlled by IR remote 
- Autonomous mode 
- Monitor mode 

Robot Assembly Instructions: 

Step 1) 3D Printed Parts	               

    1x Front Mount part                 
    1x Rear mount part                   
    1x Speaker cube part                  
    1x Speaker grille part              
    1x Battery holder part          
    1X Battery pack part                  
    1x HC-SR04 front part                 
    1x HC-SR04 back part                
    1x small wheel holder part
    1x small wheel holder top part
    1x small wheel part
    2x main wheel part	

Step 2) Components Bought
    
    2x Hi-Tec Servo motor
    1x Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
    1x Micro servo motor
    1x Arduino Nano rev. 3
